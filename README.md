# Netflix-Movie-Analysis
In this project , I have focused on exploring and analyzing Netflix movies based on their genres, ratings, and popularity using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.

 Main Objective:
1.To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix movie data to:
2.Understand genre distribution
3.Categorize movies based on vote averages (popularity)
4.Visualize trends across different genres and years

Features:
1.Cleaned and processed raw movie dataset
2.Split multi-genre entries using .explode()
3.Categorized vote averages into groups: Not Popular, Below Avg, Average, Popular
4.Interactive visualizations (histograms, bar charts, pie charts)
5.Genre-wise comparisons for ratings and count

Tools & Libraries:
1.Python 
2.Pandas
3.NumPy
4.Seaborn & Matplotlib
5.Jupyter Notebook

Key Insights:
1.Most common genres on Netflix
2.Genre-wise average ratings
3.Relationship between genre and popularity
4.Year-wise release trends (optional, if added)
